    "# 📖 Basic Terminologies in Apache Beam\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to understand Beam deeply, we must first learn a few **key terms** that will appear repeatedly throughout this course.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣ Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 **What is a Pipeline?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **Pipeline** encapsulates your entire data processing task (from start to finish).  \n",
    "- This includes:\n",
    "  1. Reading input data  \n",
    "  2. Applying transformations  \n",
    "  3. Writing the output data  \n",
    "\n",
    "📌 **Key Points**  \n",
    "- All Beam driver programs must create a **Pipeline**.  \n",
    "- When we create a Pipeline, we also specify **execution options**:  \n",
    "  - These tell the pipeline **where and how to run**.  \n",
    "  - Examples:  \n",
    "    - **Direct Runner** → Local machine  \n",
    "    - **Dataflow Runner** → Google Cloud Dataflow  \n",
    "    - **Flink Runner** → Apache Flink  \n",
    "    - **Spark Runner** → Apache Spark  \n",
    "\n",
    "💡 Think of a **Pipeline** as the **whole Spark code** (input → transformations → output).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2️⃣ PCollection\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 **What is a PCollection?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "- A **PCollection** is the **data structure** used by Beam.  \n",
    "- It is equivalent to **RDDs/DataFrames in Spark** or **DataSet/DataStream in Flink**.  \n",
    "- A PCollection represents a **distributed dataset** your pipeline operates on.\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 **Bounded vs Unbounded PCollections**  \n",
    "- **Bounded** → Comes from a finite source (e.g., a file).  \n",
    "- **Unbounded** → Comes from a continuous source (e.g., Kafka, Pub/Sub, socket).  \n",
    "\n",
    "💡 Unlike Spark/Flink which use separate abstractions, Beam uses **one unified abstraction (PCollection)** for both bounded and unbounded data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔑 Characteristics of a PCollection\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Immutability**  \n",
    "   - Once created, you **cannot modify elements**.  \n",
    "   - Applying a transform creates a **new PCollection**.  \n",
    "   - Example:  \n",
    "     - `P1` → Read file  \n",
    "     - `P2` → Apply Filter on `P1`  \n",
    "     - `P3` → Apply GroupBy on `P2`  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Element Type**  \n",
    "   - All elements in a PCollection must be of the **same type**.  \n",
    "   - Beam SDK provides encoders for common types + supports **custom encodings**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **No Fine-grained Operations**  \n",
    "   - We cannot transform **specific elements only**.  \n",
    "   - Transformations apply to the **entire PCollection**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Element Timestamps**  \n",
    "   - Every element has a timestamp.  \n",
    "   - For **unbounded sources** → timestamp is assigned when element arrives.  \n",
    "   - For **bounded sources** → all elements usually share the same timestamp.  \n",
    "   - Developers can **manually assign timestamps**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "⏰ **Why timestamps matter?**  \n",
    "They are essential for **Windowing**, **Watermarks**, and handling **late data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3️⃣ PTransform\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 **What is a PTransform?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **PTransform** is a **step in your pipeline**.  \n",
    "- Equivalent to **map, filter, reduce, aggregations** in Spark/Flink.  \n",
    "\n",
    "📌 **Definition**:  \n",
    "- A PTransform takes **one or more PCollections** as input.  \n",
    "- Performs an operation (processing function).  \n",
    "- Produces **zero or more output PCollections**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "💡 Developers spend most of their time **writing and chaining PTransforms** to meet business requirements.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📝 Quick Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pipeline** → Whole workflow (Input → Transforms → Output).  \n",
    "- **PCollection** → Data container (bounded/unbounded, immutable, typed, timestamped).  \n",
    "- **PTransform** → Operations/steps applied to PCollections.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 In the next sections, we will explore these concepts with **hands-on coding** and real-world examples.\n"
